# Arduino-Weather-Station-Project

Personal project using an Arduino, BMP180 Pressure Sensor, HIH6130 Humidity Sensor, microSD breakout board, Chronodot realtime clock, and RGB LCD Shield to observe and record current atmospheric conditions.

Initial code for reading and recording observations was developed during an undergraduate course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaigne: ATMS 315 Meteorological Instrumentation, taught by Professor Eric Snodgrass. Further changes were made for style and readability.

Addition of LCD Shield integration to come. Purpose of LCD shield is to be able to observe realtime conditions without need to accessing the microSD card or connect the Arduino to a computer and read the console output.
